## Bugs and Known Issues

- skymap widget crop needs clean up of white background
- responsive UI on mobile is cropping background inconsistantly
- clicking button for "Did You Know..." only toggles show and not hide again
- clicking button for "Save to Image Gallery" can be clicked more than once and add to gallery multiple times
- background video not cropping start and end time specified in parameters after first loop
- gallery and local storage only handling images and not videos 
- image gallery only adding new image of the day to first position and removing last image, no way to specify which ones to keep

## Next Steps to Continue
### Improvements to App UI and Functionality aka Nice To Have

- hover and click IU could use color or highlight change
- convert Astroid distance data from Kilometers to Miles
- limit to data of only 3 integers past the decimal
- maybe a video gallery seperate from image gallery 
- playlist of multiple videos in background on a loop
- button that let's user add video or image as background?
- perhaps dynamically add to background playlist from a video library of favorites
- save or download favorite constellations from city search
